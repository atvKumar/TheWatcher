# TheWatcher
A Folder Watching Program, built upon
the watchdog python library.

Inspired by the lack of a simple GUI in Mac for folder watching.
And the love for python and wxpython.
Also to keep coding and challenging oneself.
To fuel the open source community with a clone of DirectoryMonitor.

Ok, who am i kidding, just started a small project to keep me distracted,
for a while.
